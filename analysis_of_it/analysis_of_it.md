# Analysis of IT
 * What things do you use?
 * What are the associated passwords?
 * Do those things have dependencies?
 * Do those dependencies have passwords?
 * Repeat, ad nauseum, until you reach services that are completely outside of your control.
 * Take all of those passwords and put them somewhere...
   1. Secure
   2. Accessible 
 * The place where you store your passwords should always be secure - less-so accessible.
 * What services do you currently provide?
 * What dependencies are needed for services need to function (personnel, paper, electricity, batteries)?
 * Store the notes related to the dependencies 
 * Summarize these dependencies, then produce a "publicly-available" list of contacts in the event that something wrong happens.
 * For every service that you provide that doesn't have a quickly-available contact information, create an account to collect and manage that information (it-support@your-domain.org).
