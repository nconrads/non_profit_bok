In February of 2013, I was asked to "sit-in" on a potential IT acquisition to ensure that the needs of the Boys and Girls Club of Monroe, GA were going to be met.  While working with on-site staff to determine those needs, I had found that the IT system of the club was largely an "as-needed, fix-as-you-go" affair.  While this style of management can be functional in the short term, a more solid foundation can mitigate future risks to core operations.  As it happens, the Boys and Girls Club of Monroe, GA is affiliated with a larger core organzation - the "Boys and Girls Club of America".  With so many different clubs of the BGCA out in the wild, I thought it would be reasonable that the main organization might have available a "Lessons Learned" or "Book of Knowledge" on IT management for its clubs.  Dan Rauzi, former Senior Director of Technology Programs at Boys and Girls Club of America, indicated that there was no such equivalent for the Boys and Girls clubs.

IT management, in this computerized era, is a truly critical component of any modern organization.  It is vastly more important when students and future teachers are exposed to IT practices through example, as each piece of knowledge may propagate like Richard Dawkins's "memes".  By providing a method for distributed non-profit organizations to coordinate knowledge, bad knowledge memes can be stopped at earlier junctures and good knowledge memes can be promoted sooner.  I believe reasonable practices can effectively raise the base knowledge level of our society.

This document seeks to provide a strong set of guidelines for implementing an effective IT infrastructure for both new organizations and current organizations that would like to identify and reduce current risk.
