# Useful Computer Applications
I've provided a list of useful applications 

## Microsoft Windows Operating System Utilities

### System Management
#### Chocolatey
Chocolatey is best described as a Windows equivalent for dpkg/rpm package management.  In short, a user is able to specify a particular application that they would like to install through a command line interface (cli), and Chocolatey will download and install the specified application in an automated fashion.  Package managers excel at acquiring updates for both applications and the dependencies of applications.

#### npackd
Another "package manager" for Windows that is in the same vein as Chocolatey.  Provides both a GUI \index(GUI) user interface and a CLI \index(CLI) user interface.
